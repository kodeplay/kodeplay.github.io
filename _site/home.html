        <h5>Verynutri - We hack for green tea.</h5>
        <p>How we were hired ?
        3 years back - we were offering ecommerce websites to customers.
        Shiv Shah sir visited us one day and spoke at length about the extensive range of health
        products he had acquired over a decade.
        <Shiv Shah photo>

        How we worked with verynutri?

        As product range is extensive and the business has b2b as well as b2c , time was a constraint
        for the founders and content creation was difficult to do.

        We did start a blog for health tips.

        We did extensive keyword research for all products with India as the boundary location.

        Website content was rewritten accordingly.

        We also worked on link building.

        we achieved below results .

        <3 photos>

        What are current plans?

        We are planning to rely on content curation and working on dashboard for the same.
        We are also working on competition workflows.
        We are looking to improve results through content curation, offers, helpful reviews, user generated content.
        Link building also needs to be automated now.

        <h5>Kamal Traders</h5>
        <p>
        How we were hired ?
        Kamal Traders is a 48 year ols flower decoration business.

        Ramesh Bajaj sir asked around and found out about our work for businesses wanting
        to start selling online.

        A colleague of his recommended us.

        How we worked with Kamal Traders.

        The business had a catalog with 72 products.

        We decided to use the "Less is More" strategy.
        I researched open source ecommerce platforms.

        I was impressed by minimal, simple design of piggybak ecommerce.
        I used it for the project immediately.I was excited about using rails as well.

        The server costs of EC2 came in for 2 months and we still did not get any orders as 
        we had not started marketing.
        We were awaiting go aheads for marketing but meanwhile the EC2 costs meter was chugging away.

        I decided to try jekyll and github pages to save costs and also try and get faster page load times.
        The result is here - 

        You can read more about how eric and aaron's coding sprint here - 

        What are current plans ?

        Everyone is happy (almost delightful) with the website.
        We are looking forward to growth hack on this one.

        <h5>Carfixers</h5>
        <p>
        Amit Gala - a young, strong entrepreneur contacted vineet naik to implement a new idea.
        We were lucky to have vineet naik as our CTO till 2014.
        Vineet referred us and Amit Gala visited us.

        On discussing with Amit, I found that he had a strong insight about the car maintainence segment and he could easily think 3 years ahead of every idea in this space.
        Amit wanted to improve lives of car mechanics and also try and offer value to car owners.

        He agreed to follow lean startup method and we started a blog to build an audience.

        How we worked with carfixers?

        The team working on the blog had in depth domain knowledge and were new to digital marketing.

        We demoed few techniques for them to get initial followers and discussed how they could find content creation ideas.

        They did create valuable information and are now enjoying the result of the same.

        <4 photos>
        What are current plans ?

        We are soon going to start working on auditing content and link building.
        Everyone is excited about CARFIXERS and to make hassle free car maintainence possible f     or everyone.

        <h5>3digiprints</h5>
        <p>How we got hired?

        Few Months back, I was hanging out at therodinhoods.com
        Luckily ---  recommended our work to chandan mishra - the founder at 3digiprints.
        ?photo?

        We discussed in depth about goals of 3digiprints.

        How we worked at 3figiprints?
        We sketched wireframes for each page and iterated.
        We started coding using materialize css and were happy with the results.

        Content creation is now in progress.
        We felt we should have completed content creation as the first step .

        We used jekyll and github pages for faster loading time and also to avoid hosting costs.
        Thanks to jekyll, we have created a minimal , simple , fast loading website.

        Further speed optimizations are on our TODO list as well.
