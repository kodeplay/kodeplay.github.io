        <h5>How we got hired ?</h5>

<p>Amit Gala - a young, strong entrepreneur contacted vineet naik to implement a new idea.<br/>
We were lucky to have vineet naik as our CTO till 2014.               <br/>
Vineet referred us and Amit Gala visited us.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>On discussing with Amit, I found that he had a strong insight about the car maintainence segment and he could easily think 3 years ahead of every idea in this space.<br/>
Amit wanted to improve lives of car mechanics and also try and offer value to car owners.                                                    <br/></p>

<p>He agreed to follow lean startup method and we started a blog to build an audience.                                                          </p>

<h5>How we worked with carfixers?</h5>

<p>The team working on the blog had in depth domain knowledge and were new to digital marketing.</p>

<p>We demoed few techniques for them to get initial followers and discussed how they could find content creation ideas.</p>

<p>They did create valuable information and are now enjoying the result of the same.</p>

<h5>What are current plans ?</h5>

<p>We are soon going to start working on auditing content and link building.<br/>
Everyone is excited about CARFIXERS and to make hassle free car maintainence possible for everyone.</p>
