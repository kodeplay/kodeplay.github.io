        <h5>How we were hired ?</h5>

<p>Kamal Traders is a 48 year old flower decoration business.</p>

<p>Ramesh Bajaj sir asked around and found out about our work for businesses wanting to start selling online.<br/>
A colleague of his recommended us.</p>

<h5>How we worked with Kamal Traders?</h5>

<p>The business had a catalog with 72 products.</p>

<p>We decided to use the &quot;Less is More&quot; strategy.<br/>
I researched open source ecommerce platforms.</p>

<p>I was impressed by minimal, simple design of piggybak ecommerce.<br/>
I used it for the project immediately.I was excited about using rails as well.</p>

<p>The server costs of EC2 came in for 2 months and we still did not get any orders as customer had not started marketing.<br/>
We were awaiting go aheads for marketing but meanwhile the EC2 costs meter was chugging away.</p>

<p>I decided to try jekyll and github pages to save costs and also try and get faster page load times.                         <br/>
The result is here - </p>

<p>What are current plans ?</p>

<p>Everyone is happy (almost delightful) with the website.<br/>
We are looking forward to growth hack on this one if we get a chance :)</p>
