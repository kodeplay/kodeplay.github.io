Invest in marketing and opt for free static website hosting.

We found that giving more effort and money on building a Web application for a small start up E-commerce is of no use. Instead a start up e-comm company should focus on [marketing][kodeplay] and build a basic understandable website.

[kamaltraders.in][kamaltraders], our client is from where we started.
Last year in 2014 our client asked us to create an e commerce website. He gave us the catalog (products, images etc). We brought hosting and installed a fresh copy of [piggybak][piggybak].
Did some customization, imported the catalog data and made the site live.

But then results were not seen, client was not getting much orders. That was because he failed in marketing.

Then we came with a [marketing plan][kodeplay]  and also suggested our client to save on hosting cost by going with git hub pages.

Git hub pages can serve HTML content only no scripts can be executed there.
So for building the website we used [jekyll][jekyll]. Jekyll takes dynamic content in json/csv format and can be integrated in html files. You can find the documentation here.

Once the site is ready we can use the below link for hosting on git hub.
[https://pages.github.com/][github_pages]
On the above url please select "Project Site" and then "Start from Scratch".
Follow all the steps and you will get an url something like : [http://username.github.io/repository][repo_url]

Once the hosting is done you will need to point you domain to git hub. For doing this you can follow below link:
[https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/][domain_help]

Once done correctly you will have your site working.
