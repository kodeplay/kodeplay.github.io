Amit Gala - a young, strong entrepreneur contacted vineet naik to implement a new idea.<br/>

On discussing with Amit, I found that he had a strong insight about the car maintainence segment and he could easily think 3 years ahead of every idea in this space.<br/>
Amit wanted to improve lives of car mechanics and also try and offer value to car owners.                                                    <br/>

He agreed to follow lean startup method and we started a blog to build an audience.                                                          


#####How we worked with carfixers?


The team working on the blog had in depth domain knowledge and were new to digital marketing.

We demoed few techniques for them to get initial followers and discussed how they could find content creation ideas.

They did create valuable information and are now enjoying the result of the same.
