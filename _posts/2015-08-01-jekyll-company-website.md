#####How we got hired ?

Few Months back, I was hanging out at therodinhoods.com<br/>
Luckily a rodinhoods member recommended our work to chandan mishra - the founder at 3digiprints.<br/>

We discussed in depth about goals of 3digiprints.<br/>

#####How we worked at 3digiprints?
We sketched wireframes for each page and iterated.    <br/>
We started coding using materialize css and were happy with the results.

Content creation is now in progress.<br/>
We felt we should have completed content creation as the first step as once the content is created, we may need to make an iteration.

We used jekyll and github pages for faster loading time and also to avoid hosting costs.                                             <nr/>
Thanks to jekyll, we have created a minimal , simple , fast loading website.

Further speed optimizations are on our TODO list as well.
