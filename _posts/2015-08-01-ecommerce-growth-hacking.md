##### 
<p class="standard_font_head">How we were hired ? </p>
<p class="standard_font">
3 years back - we were offering ecommerce websites to customers.
<br/>
Shiv Shah sir visited us one day and spoke at length about the extensive range of health
products he had learned to create over a decade.

##### How we worked with verynutri?

<p class="standard_font">
As product range is extensive and the business has b2b as well as b2c , time was a constraint
for the founders and content creation was difficult to do.<br/>
We did start a blog for health tips.<br/>
We did extensive keyword research for all products with India as the boundary location.<br/>
Website content was rewritten accordingly.<br/>
We also worked on link building.<br/>
We achieved below results .

##### What are current plans?

<p class="standard_font">
We are planning to rely on content curation and working on dashboard for the same.<br/>
We are also working on competition workflows.          <br/>
We are looking to improve results through content curation, offers, helpful reviews, user generated content.<br/>
Link building also needs to be automated now.
