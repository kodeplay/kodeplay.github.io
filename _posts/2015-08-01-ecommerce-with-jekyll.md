#####How we worked with Kamal Traders?

<p class="standard_font">
The business had a catalog with 72 products.

We decided to use the "Less is More" strategy.<br/>
I researched open source ecommerce platforms.

I was impressed by minimal, simple design of piggybak ecommerce.<br/>
I used it for the project immediately.I was excited about using rails as well.

The server costs of EC2 came in for 2 months and we still did not get any orders as customer had not started marketing.<br/>
We were awaiting go aheads for marketing but meanwhile the EC2 costs meter was chugging away.

I decided to try jekyll and github pages to save costs and also try and get faster page load times.                         <br/>
The result is here - 


What are current plans ?

Everyone is happy (almost delightful) with the website.<br/>
We are looking forward to growth hack on this one if we get a chance :)
